/**
 * @file
 * This is a Thread Safe Error handling Library. (How safe is still to be
 * determined.) The name ErrorLib was already taken. TSError might work, but
 * Terror was more fun to use. Named tErrorLib just in case of 
 * any conflicts with others who use "terror".
 *
 * This library is a generalized error flagging library. When an error 
 * occurs, this library allows you to set an error condition (a number 
 * and/or string) which can be fetched by at a later time (perhaps in a 
 * different module). It is analgous to perror or glGetError(), though
 * perhaps a closer analogy might be to SDL_SetError() as this library 
 * allows you to deal with both integer numbers as well as printf-style
 * formatted strings.
 *
 * This library also attempts to implement a certain degree of thread 
 * safety. The problem with a general access error system used 
 * by multiple threads is the risk of clobbering error messages set 
 * in one thread by error messages set in other threads before you 
 * get a chance to read them. This library solves that problem by 
 * creating separate error message structures for every unique thread.
 *
 * This library is unique in several ways. First, this is an entirely
 * self-contained, error-handling-only library. Most people seem to at 
 * best rewrite their own error handling system for each library they write 
 * (and at worst, don't write any error handling system at all).
 * 
 * Second, because this library is intended for just error handling, 
 * it was designed with the idea that it could be dropped into any 
 * library you choose and you are allowed to have separate/isolated 
 * error "pools". So for example, if you were writing multiple modules,
 * such as a graphics library, a sound library, and an application core, 
 * you might desire to have separate error pools for each system so 
 * they don't collide.
 * In order to accommodate the possible multiple instance of pools, the 
 * library has been factored into an object-oriented structure. Since 
 * this library is C-based, it does impose an additional parameter to 
 * be passed around than what people might be used to, but this 
 * API could be wrapped easily that hides the object pointer using a
 * static or global variable for your module if you choose.
 *
 * Finally, this library allows the use of either/both integer or string
 * errors. Integer error numbers allow for quick access and easy comparison.
 * It may also allow for easier internationalization of error messages 
 * if you maintain a look-up-table.
 * String error messages are nice because you know what the problem is 
 * immediately (don't have to hunt down or figure out what error 427 means).
 * They also help make the code self documenting. And if you have errors 
 * nested down in function call layers, you can easily report the 
 * function call stack by appending information to the error string
 * at each function call.
 * 
 * Keep in mind that this library isn't meant to replace other error 
 * reporting conventions, but to supplement them. Functions that return 
 * error values (true/false,int) and logging systems (Logger) are still
 * good systems that may address other issues. You might continue 
 * using error codes for your functions and then use tErrorLib to 
 * fetch the error string when you need them. And to log the error, 
 * you might pass the string into Logger.
 *
 * There are two different ways to use this library with respect to 
 * retrieving errors. You can treat each thread separately and let each
 * live in its own separate world. When you retrieve the error, you only 
 * retrieve the error for the current thread. You should use the
 * TError_GetErrorOnCurrentThread family of functions for this scenario.
 * Alternatively, you can use this library to always return you the last
 * set error regardless of the thread it was set in. You should use the
 * TError_GetLastError family of functions for this scenario.
 * 
 * Sample Usage:
 * @code
 * TErrorPool* err_pool;
 * TErrorStatus error_status;
 * 
 * err_pool = TError_CreateErrorPool();
 * if(NULL == err_pool)
 * {
 *	 	fprintf(stderr, "Error, could not create error pool\n");
 *  	exit(1);
 * }
 *
 * // Set a hypothetical error
 * TError_SetError(err_pool, -1234, "Demo error #%d: %s", 222, "Hello");
 *
 * // Check/get the error using the isolated thread usage model.
 * // Might use TError_GetErrorNumOnCurrentThread or TError_GetErrorStrOnCurrentThread instead
 * error_status = TError_GetErrorOnCurrentThread(err_pool);
 * // Make sure the string is not NULL before printing it with printf.
 * // (Some systems let you print NULL, but on Solaris, it seg faults.)
 * if(NULL != error_status.errorString)
 * {
 * 		printf("%d: %s", error_status.errorNumber, error_status.errorString);
 * }
 *
 * // not really necessary to call since single threaded and
 * // going to delete the entire pool right after, but here for show.
 * TError_DeleteEntryOnCurrentThread(err_pool);
 *
 * TError_FreeErrorPool(err_pool);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Sample API Wrapping:
 * This is an example of how you might want to wrap this library into
 * your own API code so you don't have to expose the error pool.
 * This example uses the last set error usage model.
 * (If you didn't want to use both integers and strings, you could 
 * also make that decision here.)
 *
 * @code
 * #include "tErrorLib.h"
 * static TErrorPool* s_ErrorPool = NULL; // static error pool for this module 
 * 
 * int MyLibraryInit()
 * {
 * 		// Presumably you have you application specific code here too.
 * 		s_ErrorPool = TError_CreateErrorPool();
 * 		if(NULL == s_ErrorPool)
 * 		{
 * 			return 0; // couldn't allocate memory
 * 		}
 * 		return 1;
 * }
 * 
 * void MyLibraryQuit()
 * {
 * 		TError_FreeErrorPool(s_ErrorPool);
 * 		s_ErrorPool = NULL;
 * }
 * 
 * void MyLibrarySetError(int err_num, const char* err_str, ...)
 * {
 * 		va_list argp;
 * 		va_start(argp, err_str);
 * 		TError_SetErrorv(s_ErrorPool, err_num, err_str, argp);
 * 		va_end(argp);
 * }
 *
 * const char* MyLibraryGetError()
 * {
 * 		const char* ret_error = TError_GetLastErrorStr(s_ErrorPool);
 * 		if(NULL == ret_error)
 *      {
 * 		 		return ""; // provide an empty string to make it safe for people using printf without checking.
 * 		}
 * 		return ret_error;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note By default, this library attempts to use vasprintf to generate
 * the printf-style formatted strings. vasprintf is a GNU extension 
 * which solves the problem of having enough memory allocated in a buffer
 * to handle an arbitrary length formatted string which you don't know
 * in advance. I recommend you use this implementation if your library
 * can support it as it will allow you to always generate correct strings.
 * (Stack traces can become long and exceed your preallocated buffer sizes.)
 * For compatibility, an alternative vsnprintf implementation is provided.
 * If a string is too large, it will be truncated. vsnprintf is specified 
 * in C99, but it critcal for avoid security related issues surrounding 
 * sprintf and vsprintf. If your library lacks vsnprintf, you're asking 
 * for trouble. I currently do not try to handle this case.
 * 
 * @note By default, this library assumes 0 is the no-error value.
 * In addition, if you are using the string-only based APIs, the integer
 * components will be automatically filled to 0 (for no-error) and 
 * 1 (for error). If these numbers conflict with your conventions,
 * you may be able to change these values in the implementation file
 * and recompile the library. Look for the defines for TERROR_ERROR_VALUE
 * and TERROR_NOERROR_VALUE.
 *
 * @note This version attempts to provide enough thread safety to get by
 * but it may not be totally safe during creation and destruction of 
 * instances (partly since locking is done inside the object-level),
 * so don't create or destroy pools when there is possible contention.
 * Strings you pass into the functions are not necessarily locked so
 * be careful if you are modifying strings that are shared among
 * your threads.
 *
 * @note Error strings returned are pointers to tErrorLib's internal 
 * copies of strings. Do not modify these or delete them. Also keep in 
 * mind that the pointers to these strings may become invalid when
 * a new error is set (on a per-thread basis). So if you need a copy 
 * of the error string, you should make your own copy.
 *
 * @warning For code that frequently generates and destroys many threads,
 * be aware that you should pay attention to memory management with this 
 * library. This library works by creating a unique error message 
 * structure for each thread. When the thread dies, the error pool 
 * will still contain a structure for that thread (if it had called 
 * this library in that thread). Just before the thread dies (but after 
 * any final error calls), you should call TError_DeleteEntryOnCurrentThread()
 * to free the memory for that thread. Otherwise you will have a 
 * pseudo-memory-leak. (Pseudo in the sense that once you free the error pool,
 * all memory will be freed, regardless of whether you remembered to call
 * this function.)

/**
 * This library determines if there is an error by checking 
 * both the error number and error string. If the error string is NULL
 * and the error number is 0 (TERROR_NOERROR_VALUE), then it 
 * is considered a non-error. Because this library allows you to
 * use just numbers or just strings, a value must be filled in internally
 * as a place holder. It also must return some default/no-error values
 * for GetError if there was no error. In these situations,
 * NULL is set for strings and 0 (TERROR_NOERROR_VALUE)
 * is set for numbers. This will become a point of confusion if you use 
 * 0 as an error code to denote a legitimate error and have a NULL error 
 * string. 
 * 
 * To accommodate this problem, this define is provided to let you 
 * redefine what the no-error value is (though this is untested). 
 * If you have the opportunity to write code that doesn't rely on 0 denoting
 * an error, I recommend using this library as is, instead of trying 
 * to change this. If you do change this value, remember you must recompile
 * the entire library. Also make sure that TERROR_ERROR_VALUE (in 
 * implementation file) is not equal to your changed value.
 * 
 * For most cases, if you just want to check if there was an 
 * error, you can check if the error_number == 0. But if
 * you are thinking that you may want to redefine what the no-error
 * value is in the future (say -99999), then you can use this 
 * constant name instead (e.g. error_number == TERROR_NOERROR_VALUE).
