 /**
 * @mainpage
 * ALmixer (which I sometimes call "SDL-OpenAL-Mixer" or "SDL_ALmixer") is a cross-platform audio library built 
 * on top of OpenAL to make playing and managing sounds easier. 
 * ALmixer provides a simple API inspired by SDL_mixer to make playing sounds easy 
 * with having to worry about directly dealing with OpenAL sources, buffers, 
 * and buffer queuing directly.
 * ALmixer currently utilizes SDL_sound behind the scenes to decode 
 * various audio formats such as WAV, MP3, AAC, MP4, OGG, etc.
 *
 * This library is targeted towards two major groups:
 * - People who just want an easy, high performance, way to play audio (don't care if its OpenAL or not)
 * - People who want to an easy way to play audio in OpenAL but still want access to OpenAL directly.
 *  
 * ALmixer exposes OpenAL sources in the API so you can freely use ALmixer 
 * in larger OpenAL applications that need to apply OpenAL 3D effects and features 
 * to playing sounds.
 *
 * The API is heavily influenced and inspired by SDL_mixer, though there is one major
 * conceptual design difference. ALmixer doesn't divide sound and music playback into two
 * separate play APIs. Instead, there is one unified play API and you specify via the 
 * load API whether you want the audio resource loaded as a stream or completely preloaded.
 * This allows you to have any arbitrary number of streaming sources playing simultaneously
 * (such as music and speech) unlike SDL_mixer where you are limited to only one "music" 
 * channel.
 *
 * A less major conceptual design difference is every "Channel" API has a corresponding "Source" API.
 * Every "channel" (in the SDL_mixer definition context) maps to a corresponding OpenAL source id. You can use
 * this source ID directly with OpenAL API commands to utilize OpenAL effects such as position, Doppler, etc.
 * Convenience APIs are provided to let you convert channel numbers to source ids and vice-versa.
 *
 * Another change which is a pet-peev of mine with SDL_mixer is the lack of a user_data parameter in callbacks.
 * ALmixer callbacks allow you to pass user_data (aka context) pointers through the callback functions.
 *
 * @note There are some #defines you can set to change the behavior at compile time. Most you shouldn't touch.
 * The one worth noting is ENABLE_ALMIXER_THREADS. If enabled, ALmixer_Update() is automatically called on a 
 * background thread so you no longer have to explicitly call it. (The function turns into a no-op so your existing
 * code won't break.) Having Update run in a separate thread has some advantages, particularly for streaming
 * audio as all the OpenAL buffer queuing happens in this function. It is less likely the background thread will
 * be blocked for long periods and thus less likely your buffer queues will be starved. However, this means you 
 * need to be extra careful about what you do in callback functions as they are invoked from the background thread.
 * I still consider this feature a experimental (though I am starting to use it more myself) and there
 * may still be bugs.

 * around OpenAL because OpenAL lacks support for this kind of thing.
 * As such, buffers are copied at decode time, and there is no attempt to do
 * fine grained timing syncronization. You will be provided the entire buffer
 * that is decoded regardless of length. So if you predecoded the entire 
 * audio file, the entire data buffer will be provided in a single callback.
 * If you stream the data, you will be getting chunk sizes that are the same as
 * what you specified the decode size to be. Unfortunely, this means if you 
 * pick smaller buffers, you get finer detail at the expense/risk of buffer 
 * underruns. If you decode more data, you have to deal with the syncronization
 * issues if you want to display the data during playback in something like an
 * oscilloscope.
 *
 * @note You may call this function before initializing ALmixer. 
 * This was done to facilite wrapper libraries around ALmixer where you needed to intercept all callbacks
 * to monitor state (for things likes channel resources available or ALmixer_Data* that is in use).
 * But as a consequence, the things you set in this function will persist across Init/Quit calls.
 * If you need to clear or change the values, you must call this function again with the new values.
 * 
 * @warning You should not call other ALmixer functions in this callback. 
 * Particularly in the case of when compiled with threads, recursive locking
 * will occur which will lead to deadlocks. Also be aware that particularly in the 
 * threaded case, the callbacks may (and currently do) occur on a background thread.
 * One typical thread safe strategy is to set flags or schedule events to occur on the
 * main thread.
 * 
 * @param playback_data_callback The function you want called back.
 * Passing NULL (which is the default) disables the callback.
 * 
 * @param which_channel The ALmixer channel that the data is currently playing on.
 * @param al_source The OpenAL source that the data is currently playing on.
 * @param pcm_data This is a pointer to the data buffer containing ALmixer's 
 * version of the decoded data. Consider this data as read-only. In the 
 * non-threaded backend, this data will persist until potentially the next call
 * to Update(). Currently, data buffers are preallocated and not destroyed
 * until FreeData() is called (though this behavior is subject to change),
 * but the contents will change when the buffer needs to be reused for a 
 * future callback. The buffer reuse is tied to the amount of buffers that
 * may be queued.
 * But assuming I don't change this, this may allow for some optimization
 * so you can try referencing data from these buffers without worrying 
 * about crashing. (You still need to be aware that the data could be 
 * modified behind the scenes on an Update().)
 * The data type listed is an signed 8-bit format, but the real data may
 * not actually be this. ALbyte was chosen as a convenience. If you have 
 * a 16 bit format, you will want to cast the data and divide the num_bytes by 2.
 * Typically, data is either Sint16. This seems to be a 
 * convention audio people seem to follow though I'm not sure what the 
 * underlying reasons (if any) are for this. I suspect that there may be 
 * some nice alignment/conversion property if you need to cast between ALbyte
 * and ALubyte.
 * 
 * @param num_bytes This is the total length of the data buffer. It presumes
 * that this length is measured for ALbyte. So if you have Sint16 data, you
 * should divide num_bytes by two if you access the data as Sint16.
 * 
 * @param frequency The frequency the data was decoded at.
 *
 * @param num_channels_in_sample 1 for mono, 2 for stereo. Not to be confused with the ALmixer which_channel.
 *
 * @param bit_depth Bits per sample. This is expected to be 8 or 16. This 
 * number will tell you if you if you need to treat the data buffer as 
 * 16 bit or not.
 * 
 * @param is_unsigned 1 if the data is unsigned, 0 if signed. Using this
 * combined with bit_depth will tell you if you need to treat the data
 * as ALubyte, ALbyte, ALuint, or ALint.
 *
 * @param decode_mode_is_predecoded This is here to tell you if the data was totally 
 * predecoded or loaded as a stream. If predecoded, you will only get 
 * one data callback per playback instance. (This might also be true for 
 * looping the same sample...I don't remember how it was implemented. 
 * Maybe this should be fixed.)
 * 0 (ALMIXER_DECODE_STREAM) for streamed.
 * 1 (ALMIXER_DECODE_ALL) for predecoded.
 *
 * @param length_in_msec This returns the total length (time) of the data 
 * buffer in milliseconds. This could be computed yourself, but is provided
 * as a convenince.
 *
 * @param user_data The user data you pass in will be passed back to you in the callback. NULL is allowed.
